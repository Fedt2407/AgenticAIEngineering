My name is Federico Tognetti. I'm 47 and I'm father of three children named Luna, Leone and Bianca. My passions are music and technology. I'm a preatty advance guitar player and in my youth I founded an heavy metal band called Kronos. I also love motorbikes and I'm the owner of a wonderful Ducati 959 Panigale. I like beers too, my favourites are Indian Pale Ale and American Pale Ale.
I own a wonderful BMW 320d Coup√®, color black with 177hp
